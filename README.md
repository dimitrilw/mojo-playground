# mojo-playground

Playing around with Modular's Mojo üî• programming language.

This repo is just a collection of random snippets and experiments.

This readme is just a semi-chaotic list of notes and references
gathered while playing around with Mojo.

The `/notes` directory contains additional misc notes & snippets. I'll move
things there as appropriate.

## immediate tasks

- tidy this readme
- finish watching all Youtube videos in my Mojo playlist
- read the backlog of articles at:
  - [Modular newsletters](https://www.modular.com/newsletters)
  - [mojo-dojo](https://mojodojo.dev/)
  - [joy of mojo](https://joyofmojo.com/)
- figure out configs
  - auto-formatting
  - tests
    - first, what is best-practice? Pytest?
    - second, set-up VS-Code like Google's Go extension to auto-run and make the
      entire output all pretty: per-test lights, linkage to code lines, etc.
  - auto-completion in VS-Code
- packaging
  - package management
    - [mojopack](https://github.com/kernhanda/mojopack)
    - [pkm](https://github.com/Hammad-hab/pkm)
  - how to publish a package
- Mojo versions
  ‚Äì How pin Mojo version? Is there a mojo.config file?
  - How switch versions? Is there a ‚Äúnvm‚Äù type command?
- contrib to repos
  - [mojolings](https://github.com/dbusteed/mojolings), like rustlings
- VS-Code stuff
  - explore the features (like shortcuts) of the Mojo extension
  - ensure I have set-up Jupyter Notebook support
- convert some of my old repos to Mojo; remember to check Gitlab & Bitbucket
- Awesome Mojo repos
  - [mojicians](https://github.com/mojicians/awesome-mojo)
  - [ego](https://github.com/ego/awesome-mojo)
  - [mojo is awesome](https://github.com/mfranzon/mojo-is-awesome)
- redo [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in Mojo

## future projects

I'd like to contribute to a few Mojo projects.

- Discord bot
  - model on discord.py
    - [docs](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    - [repo](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
- WASM compile for deployment to:
  - Fermyon Spin
  - Cloudflare Workers
- roguelike:
  - from bare-bones
  - as a "how to refactor py to mojo" exercise with a py roguelike
- todo.app
- 2048 game
- Mojo website? Like, make some demo blog or something just to show Mojo Django,
  or whatever.
- search for other code samples to explore
- mojo mud server -- like Evennia, but in Mojo
- Mojo Podcast?

## code challenges

- perhaps do local setup with CodeAbbey for solving via Mojo?
  - [directions](https://www.codeabbey.com/index/wiki/running)
